# Deployment Documentation

This documentation covers the deployment process for the SaaS Boilerplate application.

## Overview

The application supports deployment to multiple environments:

- **Development** - For testing new features
- **Staging** - For pre-production testing
- **Production** - For live application use

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Laravel Forge Deployment (Recommended)

We provide automated scripts for deploying to Laravel Forge:

- [Laravel Forge Setup Guide](forge-setup.md)
- [Deployment Automation](automation.md)
- [Environment Configuration](automation.md#environment-configuration)

### 2. Server Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Nginx or Apache
- MySQL 8.0+ or PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis (for queue processing and caching)
- SSL certificate

Detailed server requirements and setup instructions are available in:
- [Server Provisioning Guide](server-provisioning.md)

### 3. Deployment Scripts

Several scripts are provided to automate the deployment process:

- `bin/configure-forge.sh` - Sets up Forge environments
- `bin/deploy-forge.sh` - Deploys to specified environment
- `bin/health-check.sh` - Verifies deployment health

### 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

- [Monitoring Guide](monitoring.md)
- [Backup Configuration](backup-config.sh)

## Zero-Downtime Deployment

Our deployment process uses a zero-downtime approach:

1. Put the application in maintenance mode with a retry parameter
2. Pull the latest code changes
3. Install dependencies
4. Run database migrations
5. Clear and optimize caches
6. Build assets
7. Restart queue workers
8. Bring the application back online
9. Perform health checks

For detailed implementation, see the [deployment script](deploy-script.sh).

## Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failures, automated rollback is supported:

```bash
# Manual rollback to previous state
./bin/deploy-forge.sh [environment] [previous-branch] rollback
```

The system also creates deployment snapshots before each deployment that can be used for recovery.

## CI/CD Integration

The deployment process integrates with GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- Automated testing on push to main branch
- Code coverage reporting
- Deployment to staging environment on successful test completion

See the [CI/CD configuration](../.github/workflows/tests.yml) for details.

- [Monitoring](monitoring.md) (Coming soon)

## Deployment Options

The recommended deployment method is using Laravel Forge with either:
- DigitalOcean droplets
- AWS EC2 instances

The documentation will cover setting up zero-downtime deployments, SSL configuration, worker processes, and backup strategies.
