# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status (April 19, 2025)
- Line Coverage: 78.85% (Target: 95%+)
- Methods Coverage: 65.12%
- Classes Coverage: 22.22%

## Immediate Actions (Coverage Sprint)

### 1. Coverage Analysis and Gap Identification
- [ ] Generate detailed HTML coverage report
  ```bash
  XDEBUG_MODE=coverage php artisan test --coverage-html build/coverage
  ```
- [ ] Review uncovered code paths in HTML report
- [ ] Create list of missing test scenarios

### 2. Test Suite Enhancement
`tests/Feature/`:
- [ ] Complete AuthenticationTest.php scenarios
  - [ ] Password reset flow
  - [ ] Email verification process
  - [ ] Token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Enhance ProjectTest.php
  - [ ] Edge cases for soft deletes
  - [ ] Search functionality corner cases
  - [ ] Pagination edge scenarios
- [ ] Expand TaskTest.php
  - [ ] Task state transitions
  - [ ] Relationship cascades
  - [ ] Validation edge cases

`tests/Unit/`:
- [ ] Complete Models/UserTest.php
  - [ ] Relationship testing
  - [ ] Attribute casting
  - [ ] Scope methods
- [ ] Enhance Models/ProjectTest.php
  - [ ] Search functionality unit tests
  - [ ] Soft delete behaviors
  - [ ] Relationship management
- [ ] Complete Policies/TaskPolicyTest.php
  - [ ] Authorization edge cases
  - [ ] Owner/non-owner scenarios
  - [ ] Deleted resource handling

### 3. New Test Coverage
- [ ] Create ProjectSearchTest.php
  - [ ] Database-agnostic search
  - [ ] Special character handling
  - [ ] Empty results scenarios
- [ ] Create TaskStateTest.php
  - [ ] State transitions
  - [ ] Validation rules
  - [ ] Error conditions

### 4. Process Implementation

#### Immediate Process
1. Run coverage analysis
2. Identify uncovered paths
3. Write missing tests
4. Verify coverage improvement
5. Repeat until 95% reached

#### Continuous Process
For each new feature:
1. Write feature specification
2. Create test cases before implementation
3. Implement feature
4. Verify coverage maintained at 95%+
5. Add regression tests as needed

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow
  - [ ] Enforce coverage thresholds
  - [ ] Fail builds below 95%
  - [ ] Generate coverage badges
- [ ] Add coverage gates to PR process
  - [ ] Block merges below threshold
  - [ ] Require coverage report review

### 6. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update testing documentation
  - [ ] Coverage requirements
  - [ ] Test writing guidelines
  - [ ] Coverage checking process
- [ ] Add coverage monitoring guide
  - [ ] Local coverage checking
  - [ ] CI/CD integration details
  - [ ] Coveralls configuration

## Monitoring Plan
- Daily: Run local coverage checks
- Per PR: Review coverage impact
- Weekly: Full coverage audit
- Monthly: Coverage trend analysis

## Success Metrics
- Line Coverage: 95%+ (Required)
- Method Coverage: 90%+ (Target)
- Class Coverage: 90%+ (Target)
- Zero untested critical paths
- All new features fully covered

## Timeline
Week 1:
- Coverage analysis
- High-impact test addition
- Process documentation

Week 2:
- Complete missing test scenarios
- Implement CI/CD updates
- Review and adjust process

## Maintenance Strategy
1. Coverage Monitoring:
   - Pre-commit hooks for local coverage
   - PR checks for coverage impact
   - Weekly coverage reports

2. New Feature Process:
   - TDD approach required
   - Coverage checks in PR template
   - Automated coverage verification

3. Documentation:
   - Living test documentation
   - Coverage requirements in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Regular process reviews
