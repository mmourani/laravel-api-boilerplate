# SaaS Boilerplate Implementation Plan

Below is a structured plan to cover the missing critical components and enhancements.

## Phase 1: Testing & CI/CD (Week 1) ✅
1. **GitHub Actions Setup** ✅ 
   - Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) with the following steps:  
     - Use PHP 8.2  
     - Set up MySQL or SQLite for testing  
     - Use Composer cache  
     - Run PHPUnit tests  
     - Submit code coverage to Coveralls  
   - Update `phpunit.xml` to properly configure test coverage paths and environment variables.  
   - Configure Coveralls to generate coverage badges, including ensuring correct paths for coverage.  
2. **Expand Test Suite** ✅
   - Add Feature Tests for:
     - Authentication flows  
     - Project CRUD operations  
     - Task management  
     - Policy enforcement  
   - Add Unit Tests for:
     - Model relationships  
     - Policy logic  
     - Helper functions  
   - Create test factories and seeders for consistent data setup.

## Phase 2: Laravel Forge Setup (Week 1-2)
1. **Deployment Configuration**  
   - Create zero-downtime deployment scripts and environment configuration.  
   - Set up SSL certificates, queue workers, and scheduling (e.g., cron for Laravel tasks).  
   - Configure backups for the application and databases.  
2. **Documentation for Server Provisioning**  
   - Outline recommended droplet or instance specs on DigitalOcean or AWS.  
   - Detail steps for setting up security groups, the database, and environment variables.

## Phase 3: Enhanced Debugging (Week 2)
1. **Three-Level Debug System**  
   - Level 1 (Basic): Request/response logging, error tracking, performance metrics  
   - Level 2 (Detailed): Query logging, cache operations, queue processing  
   - Level 3 (Development): Stack traces, memory usage, request timeline  
2. **Logging Infrastructure**  
   - Configure multiple log channels (daily files, Slack notifications, external error reporting).  
   - Include a debug toolbar for local development.  
   - Provide a log viewer for easier log inspection.

## Phase 4: Core Features (Week 3-4)
1. **Authentication Enhancements**  
   - Integrate social login, two-factor authentication, API token management, and session handling.  
2. **Team Management**  
   - Implement multi-tenant architecture and role-based permissions.  
   - Allow team invitations and shared resources.  
3. **API Infrastructure**  
   - Implement rate-limiting, response caching, complete API documentation, and an SDK generator.

## Phase 5: Documentation (Ongoing)
1. **Documentation Structure**
   ```
   docs/
   ├── getting-started/
   │   ├── installation.md
   │   ├── configuration.md
   │   └── deployment.md
   ├── features/
   │   ├── authentication.md
   │   ├── authorization.md
   │   └── api-reference.md
   ├── development/
   │   ├── testing.md
   │   ├── debugging.md
   │   └── best-practices.md
   └── deployment/
       ├── forge-setup.md
       ├── scaling.md
       └── monitoring.md
   ```
2. **Documentation Updates**  
   - Maintain a GitHub Project board for tracking milestones.  
   - Keep README, CHANGELOG, and architectural decisions updated.  
   - Write clear instructions for setup, debugging, and deployment.

## Continuous Tasks
- Ensure >90% test coverage.  
- Maintain zero-downtime deployments.  
- Keep dependencies updated.  
- Regularly scan for security advisories.  
- Provide robust logs and debugging info.  
- Keep documentation updated with each new feature.

**Each new feature or enhancement should include corresponding tests, documentation updates, deployment instructions, and debug support.**
