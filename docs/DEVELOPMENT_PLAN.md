# Development Plan (Updated April 20, 2025)

## Current Sprint: Coverage Improvement and Documentation

This document outlines the current development plan and priorities for the Laravel SaaS Boilerplate project, building upon our existing implementation plan and next steps documentation.

## Immediate Focus (Sprint 1)

1. **Finalize Soft Delete and Cascade Features**
   - Review and merge 'feature/project-soft-deletes' branch
   - Ensure MySQL and SQLite compatibility
   - Expand test coverage for edge cases
   - Verify cascade behaviors at all levels

2. **Cross-Database Search Enhancements**
   - Audit search logic for database agnosticism
   - Adjust test cases for comprehensive coverage
   - Verify MySQL and SQLite compatibility
   - Document search implementation details

3. **Standardize API Pagination**
   - ✅ Implemented consistent response structure (JSON:API compatible)
   - ✅ Updated resources and response macros
   - ✅ Achieved 94% pagination test coverage
   - Example Usage:
     ```json
     {
       "data": [...],
       "links": {
         "first": "https://api.example.com/items?page=1",
         "last": "https://api.example.com/items?page=5",
         "prev": null,
         "next": "https://api.example.com/items?page=2"
       },
       "meta": {
         "current_page": 1,
         "from": 1,
         "last_page": 5,
         "path": "https://api.example.com/items",
         "per_page": 15,
         "to": 15,
         "total": 75
       }
     }
     ```
