# Test Configuration Execution Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation process for updating test configuration, setting up SQLite, and configuring coverage reporting.

## Steps

1. Repository Setup
   - Clone or pull the latest `main` branch
   - Create and switch to a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/test-config-update`)

2. Review Documentation
   - Open `docs/TEST_CONFIGURATION_PLAN.md`
   - Confirm you understand each step for SQLite, coverage, and isolation

3. Environment Preparation
   - Ensure PHP's SQLite extension is installed and enabled
   - Confirm Xdebug 3 is installed with client host `localhost`, port `9003`, and mode including `coverage` and `develop`

4. PHPUnit Configuration
   - Edit `phpunit.xml`:
## ðŸš€ Deployment & CI/CD

### Production Environment
- Laravel Forge managed servers
- Automated Git deployments
- MySQL 8.0 databases
- Queue workers via Horizon

### CI/CD Workflows
1. tests.yml:
   - PHP 8.2 test matrix
   - Xdebug coverage
   - MySQL test database
2. production.yml:
   - Forge-triggered deployments
   - Automated migrations
3. staging.yml:
   - Preview environments
   - Test data seeding

6. Test Isolation Improvements
   - Modify `TestCase.php` to wrap each test in a transaction or refresh the inâ€‘memory database
   - Add `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods to reset state between tests

7. Coverage Configuration
   - Verify Xdebug is generating coverage data
   - Run `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text --coverage-html build/coverage`
   - Confirm coverage reports appear in `build/coverage` and console

8. CI/CD Integration
   - Update GitHub Actions or other CI workflow:
     - Install SQLite and PHP extensions
     - Run PHPUnit with coverage flags
     - Upload coverage results to Coveralls or Codecov

9. Local Validation
   - Run `composer install`
   - Execute `vendor/bin/phpunit`
   - Ensure all tests pass and coverage thresholds are met

10. Commit and Pull Request
    - Commit changes using Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `test:`, etc.)
    - Push branch and open a PR targeting `main`
    - Include links to coverage report and CI status

11. Review and Merge
    - Address any feedback from reviewers
    - Merge once CI passes and coverage criteria are satisfied

## Prerequisites
- PHP with SQLite extension
- Xdebug 3.x installed and configured
- Composer
- Git

## Related Documentation
- See TEST_CONFIGURATION_PLAN.md for detailed configuration specifications
- See TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md for coverage requirements and thresholds

## Notes
- This plan assumes you have appropriate repository access and permissions
- Follow your team's code review process and coding standards
- Ensure all changes are properly tested before submitting PR
